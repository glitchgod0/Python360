# Python360 (Working Title)
Very basic Python script that aims to get info from Xbox 360 file formats. 

## Supported Formats
- CON
- LIVE/PIRS
- XEX2 - Very early, not much info is displayed. Set DEBUG to True in the script to allow this feature.

## Issues
Since this is my first orignal project the code is quite messy, I will be aiming to clean the spaghetti soon.
Haven't implemented chunking yet, could eat big chunks of memory depending on file given while its running (not very long).

## Thanks
[Free60 Wiki](https://free60.org/) - Literally couldn't have done this without this.
